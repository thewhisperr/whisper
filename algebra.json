      "By induction: true for n=0, assume for n=k, then prove for n=k+1",
      "Factor as n(n+1): product of consecutive integers is even",

      "All of the above"

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "All methods are valid proofs. The simplest is factoring: n(n+1) must be even since one of two consecutive integers is always even."

    "explanation": "Let α = √2 + √3. Then α² = 5 + 2√6 ⇒ (α² - 5)² = 24 ⇒ α⁴ - 10α² + 1 = 0. This is irreducible over ℚ."
