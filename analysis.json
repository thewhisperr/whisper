    "question": "Which statement best characterizes the epsilon-delta definition of a limit?",
    "options": [
      "For every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x - a| < δ, then |f(x) - L| < ε",
      "For some ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that if |x - a| < δ, then |f(x) - L| < ε",
      "For every δ > 0, there exists ε > 0 such that if 0 < |x - a| < δ, then |f(x) - L| < ε",
      "The function approaches L as x gets arbitrarily close to a"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The precise epsilon-delta definition requires that for ANY given tolerance ε > 0, we can find a corresponding δ > 0 such that inputs within δ of a (excluding a itself) produce outputs within ε of L."

    "question": "What is the fundamental difference between pointwise and uniform continuity?",
    "options": [
      "Pointwise continuity applies to individual points, uniform continuity applies to intervals",
      "In uniform continuity, δ depends only on ε, while in pointwise continuity, δ depends on both ε and the point",
      "Uniform continuity is stronger and implies pointwise continuity, but not vice versa",
      "Both B and C are correct"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Uniform continuity means δ can be chosen to work for all points simultaneously (depends only on ε), while pointwise continuity allows δ to vary with each point. Uniform continuity is indeed stronger and implies pointwise continuity."

    "options": [
      "Intermediate Value Theorem",
      "Mean Value Theorem", 
      "Extreme Value Theorem",
      "Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The Extreme Value Theorem states that a continuous function on a compact set (closed and bounded in ℝ) attains its maximum and minimum values. This is a fundamental result in real analysis."

    "question": "What does it mean for a function to be differentiable at a point a?",
    "options": [
      "The function is continuous at a",
      "The limit lim(h→0) [f(a+h) - f(a)]/h exists",
      "The function has a tangent line at the point (a, f(a))",
      "All of the above"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Differentiability at a point means the derivative limit exists, which automatically implies continuity at that point and the existence of a unique tangent line. All three conditions are equivalent characterizations."

      "Comparison Test",
      "Ratio Test",
      "Root Test", 
      "Integral Test"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The Ratio Test is ideal for series with factorial-like or exponential terms. For n²/3ⁿ, the ratio |aₙ₊₁/aₙ| = (n+1)²/n² · 1/3 → 1/3 < 1, confirming convergence."

      "Differentiability and continuity are equivalent",
      "There is no general relationship between them"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Differentiability implies continuity, but continuity does not imply differentiability. Classic counterexample: f(x) = |x| is continuous at x = 0 but not differentiable there."

      "Every bounded monotonic sequence converges",
      "All of the above"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The completeness of ℝ can be expressed through equivalent formulations: Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, Cauchy completeness, and monotonic sequence convergence. These all distinguish ℝ from ℚ where such properties fail."

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The MVT states there exists a point c where the instantaneous rate of change (derivative) equals the average rate of change over the interval. This is fundamental for connecting local and global behavior."

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Riemann's integrability theorem: a bounded function on [a,b] is Riemann integrable if and only if the set of its discontinuities has Lebesgue measure zero. This includes continuous functions but also some discontinuous ones."

    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the Intermediate Value Theorem?",

      "To establish the existence of roots for polynomial equations",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The IVT states that if f is continuous on [a,b] and k is between f(a) and f(b), then there exists c ∈ [a,b] such that f(c) = k. This guarantees continuous functions assume all intermediate values."
